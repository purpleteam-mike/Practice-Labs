# 🍯 Linux Honeypot Deployment Lab

This project demonstrates the deployment and monitoring of a **Linux-based honeypot** in a simulated cybersecurity environment. The purpose of this lab was to observe attacker behavior, collect network intelligence, and practice early-stage threat detection using open-source tools.

---

## ✏️ Objective

To simulate a vulnerable Linux system that attracts potential attackers, enabling the collection of behavioral and network data for analysis. This lab reinforces key Blue Team skills such as detection, monitoring, and incident documentation.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Environment

- Ubuntu 20.04 (Virtual Machine)
- Cowrie SSH/Telnet honeypot
- TCPView (for side-by-side Windows monitoring)
- Log files (system logs, honeypot interaction logs)
- VirtualBox

---

## 📊 Key Skills Demonstrated

- Honeypot deployment and configuration  
- Network monitoring & traffic observation  
- Basic intrusion analysis  
- Log file investigation  
- Virtual machine setup and snapshot management

---

## 🧪 Summary of Activity

The honeypot was successfully deployed in a VM and configured to mimic a real SSH-enabled Linux server. Logs were monitored to observe any brute-force login attempts, connection scans, or unusual activity. This project also included steps to compare activity visibility using tools like TCPView on a separate machine.

## 📤 Cybersecurity Relevance

This lab reinforces core Blue Team concepts and introduces the foundations of **deception technology**, showing how honeypots can serve as early detection systems in modern network defense strategies.
