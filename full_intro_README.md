# 🧠 Cybersecurity Lab Portfolio

Welcome to my cybersecurity lab portfolio — a growing collection of hands-on projects that reflect my evolving skills in offensive and defensive security. Each lab is rooted in simulation, analysis, and documentation, with a focus on building real-world cybersecurity awareness through a **Purple Team mindset**.

## 🎯 Mission & Mindset

My approach is grounded in the belief that strong cybersecurity professionals must understand both sides of the attack surface. I’m committed to:

- Demonstrating **leadership skills** through structured reporting, threat modeling, and critical thinking
- **Bridging the gap between Red Team and Blue Team** by applying offensive tactics to improve defensive readiness
- Practicing and documenting labs that reflect both **adversarial thinking and operational defense**

## 🛠 Current Status

- Actively completing a **Cybersecurity Professional Certificate** (Simplilearn x Purdue University)
- Developing and uploading technical labs across system security, risk management, forensic analysis, and incident response
- Building toward a career in SOC analysis, detection engineering, and ultimately threat hunting

## 🚀 Future Goals

- **CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701)**  
- **CompTIA PenTest+**  
- Continue developing labs in adversary emulation, SIEM analysis, and Purple Teaming practices  
- Begin participating in **CTFs**, **Hack The Box**, and other offensive security platforms to sharpen Red Team intuition
