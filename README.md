# üñ•Ô∏è Cybersecurity Lab Portfolio

Welcome to my cybersecurity lab portfolio; a growing collection of hands-on projects that reflect my evolving skills in offensive and defensive security. Each lab is rooted in simulation, analysis, and documentation,with a focus on building real-world cybersecurity awareness through a üü£ Purple Team mindset. 

This is my ground work and my building blocks that will build my future career goals. I plan to utilize my purple team skills and channel that into digital forensics and incident response. I can combine my attacker awareness with defender skills to investigate and respond to real-world incidents. üîé

- Bridging the gap between üî¥ Red Team and üîµ Blue Team by applying offensive tactics to improve defensive readiness

- Practicing and documenting labs that reflect both adversarial thinking and operational defense ü¶æ
