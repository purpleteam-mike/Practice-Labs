# üñ•Ô∏è Cybersecurity Lab Portfolio

Welcome to my cybersecurity lab portfolio; a growing collection of hands-on projects that reflect my evolving skills in offensive and defensive security. Each lab is rooted in simulation, analysis, and documentation,with a focus on building real-world cybersecurity awareness through a üü£ Purple Team mindset. 

This is my ground work and my building blocks that will build my future career goals. I plan to utilize my purple team skills and channel that into digital forensics and incident response. I can combine my attacker awareness with defender skills to investigate and respond to real-world incidents. üîé

## üìù Mission & Mindset

My approach is grounded in the belief that strong cybersecurity professionals must understand both sides of the attack surface. I‚Äôm committed to:

- Demonstrating leadership skills through structured reporting,threat modeling,and critical thinking

- Bridging the gap between üî¥ Red Team and üîµ Blue Team by applying offensive tactics to improve defensive readiness

- Practicing and documenting labs that reflect both adversarial thinking and operational defense ü¶æ

## ‚è≥ Current Status

- Actively completing a Cybersecurity Professional Certificate provided by Simplilearn and backed by Purdue University üîö

- üîú Actively pursuing the CompTIA Security+ Certification

- Developing and uploading technical labs that relate to my goals ‚úîÔ∏è

- Building toward a career in Digital Forensics; pursuing entry level jobs ‚úîÔ∏è (ex: SOC Analysis I, Cybersecurity Analysis I, Jr. Threat Detection Analysis, or IT Security Specialist)
