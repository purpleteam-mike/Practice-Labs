# Cybersecurity Lab Portfolio

Welcome to my cybersecurity lab portfolio; a growing collection of hands-on projects that reflect my evolving skills in offensive and defensive security. Each lab is rooted in simulation, analysis, and documentation,with a focus on building real-world cybersecurity awareness through a Purple Team mindset.

## Mission & Mindset

My approach is grounded in the belief that strong cybersecurity professionals must understand both sides of the attack surface. Iâ€™m committed to:

- Demonstrating leadership skills through structured reporting,threat modeling,and critical thinking

- Bridging the gap between Red Team and Blue Team by applying offensive tactics to improve defensive readiness

- Practicing and documenting labs that reflect both adversarial thinking and operational defense
