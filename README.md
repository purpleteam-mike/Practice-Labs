# 🖥️ Cybersecurity Lab Portfolio

Welcome to my cybersecurity lab portfolio; a growing collection of hands-on projects that reflect my evolving skills in offensive and defensive security. Each lab is rooted in simulation, analysis, and documentation,with a focus on building real-world cybersecurity awareness through a 🟣 Purple Team mindset. 

This is my ground work and my building blocks that will build my future career goals. I plan to utilize my purple team skills and channel that into digital forensics and incident response. I can combine my attacker awareness with defender skills to investigate and respond to real-world incidents. 🔎
